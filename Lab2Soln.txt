----------------------------
SOLN TO TASK:
1. How do you make the system print out the name of your home directory?

echo ~
OR echo $HOME

2. What is the parent directory of your home directory?
% echo $HOME

/Users/Vedang

In this case my home directory is "Vedang" and it's parent directory also the root directory is "Users"

3. Make a directory called dir1 under your home directory.
a) Change to this directory.
b) Make three empty files: file1 file2 and file3 under the current directory.
(You can either use the touch command or the cat > filename operator. Try both
options.)
c) Make a sub-directory called dir1-1 under the current directory.

first navigate to the home directory using "cd ~" [Lab sheet 1]
then:
mkdir dir1
cd dir1
touch file1 file2 file3
mkdir dir1-1

4. Draw the file structure of the existent files and directories under your home directory.
home directory : Vedang
                            Vedang
                              |
                              |
                            dir1
                      ________|_______________
                      |       |        |      |
                      dir1-1  file1  file2    file3

5. Remove the subdirectory dir1-1.
rmdir dir1-1 (when present working directory is dir1)

6. Try now removing dir1
cd ..
rmdir dir1
[FAILS because dir1 is not empty]
[to delete recursively or to delete a directory that is not empty along with the contents inside of it use rm -r "dir name"]


rm -r dir1 
[present working dir is root dir]


7. Store the list of all the files and directories (using ls long listing) in a file called dirfile.
ls -l > dirfile

8. Display the contents of dirfile on the screen using the cat command
cat dirfile

9. Store in a file called userlist the list of users who are currently logged into the system
who > userlist

10. Combine the contents of dirfile and userlist and store in the file called file1
cat dirfile userlist > file1

11. Print the number of lines, words and characters in file1 using the wc command
wc file1

12. Copy the contents of file1 into file2.
cp file1 file2

13. Append the following two lines into file2:
This is file2.
And I am using Linux!

echo "This is file2." >> file2
echo "And I am using Linux!" >> file2
