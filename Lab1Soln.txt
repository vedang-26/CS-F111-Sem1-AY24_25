REVIEW QUESTIONS.

1. What is the effect of typing cd ~ on your terminal? What is your working directory after
executing this command?

It changes your working directory to the home directory. Your home directory is now your working directory.

2. What is the difference between mkdir and mkdir with –p flag?
Key differences:

Parent directories:

mkdir fails if parent directories don't exist.
mkdir -p creates all necessary parent directories.

Existing directories:

mkdir gives an error if the directory exists.
mkdir -p silently continues if the directory exists.

Nested structures:

mkdir can't create nested structures in one command.
mkdir -p can create complex nested structures in one go.

3. How does the rm command differ from rmdir command? What is the use of rm –r?

rm Command
Purpose: The rm (remove) command is used to delete files and directories.
rm -r
Purpose: The rm -r command combines the rm command with the -r (recursive) option.
rm -r dirname will remove the directory named dirname and all its contents, including subdirectories and files.


4. Given files f1 and f2, how can you create a new file f3 with the contents of f1 followed
by contents of f2? (note: this requires some exploration beyond the contents of this lab
sheet)

First Concatenate f1 and f2
"cat  f1.txt f2.txt"
Redirect the output to f3
"cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt"
